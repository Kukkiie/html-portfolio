<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Kukkiie or you can called me KK. I'm a 25 years old girl from Thailand. 
  I'm interested in Nature, Adventure, Travel, Gym, Book, and Art.
</p>

<p>I'm currently work as HR consultant who solves the human management issues for many organizations. 
  My big part of work right now is analyze client business and people diagnosis and then find the best solution for client organizations. I'm enjoy with my current work. 
  I usually have to go on-site or go to the office (it sounds like not a problem, right?).
  But my passion is travel around the world...
</p>

<p>I want to go see the world and the cultures from countries around the world.
  I want to be rich but my kind of Rich is "Rich of Experiences and Rich of Memories"
  I'll never be in this age again. So I just want to go live and enjoy my life in the wild world.
</p>

<p>Long story short, this's why I'm intered in Web Development. 
  This can leads me to remote work which I can go work wherever I want to go. By the way, I'm really enjoy to do Web Dev!
